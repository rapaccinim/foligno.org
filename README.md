# Foligno.org
## About
Little Django-based project for preserving the dialect from Foligno, Italy.

Will also use [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), since it's something I'd like to try out to avoid the _js fatigue_.

This will be a very slow work-in-progress...

## Commands
### Launch server
```python
python manage.py runserver
```
### Create a new app
```python
python manage.py startapp app_name_here
```
